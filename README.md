# sign-up-form
This is a Sign-Up form I created with Vanilla HTML and CSS to keep my skills refreshed.

Mobile-Responsiveness was not considered necessary with this project. It's
focus was more to showcase aesthetic taste and, as the description briefly stated, to keep my HTML/CSS skills in check as I continue to learn other languages.
